### Dermatological classification

#### My group project is about to classificate the types of skin cancer. The first [dataset](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/) is from an ML challenge - ISIC Challenge 2018 - an it contains 10015 28x28 pixel large images.
#### I read the dataset two ways (from an .npz file and from an .csv file).

#### I'm planning to use [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/) dataset for my second dataset.

#### If anything goes well, I want to draw a bounding box around the suspicious area and a probability value.

##### I'm also planning to implement this model in an Android application. The App would use the camera of the phone and the application draws a bounding box around the suspicious area and inform the user about it's prediction.
